# Alex Kibler Coding Challenge

This web app is my submission for the Stack Sports coding challenge. 

## Getting Started

To check out my submission, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

You're gonna need `node` and `npm` or `yarn`. Make sure you have those.

### Installing

Clone this bad boy into the directory of your choice:

```
git clone this-awesome-solution-that-alex-made.git
```

Then install necessary packages:

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

Lastly, you want to start the React server:

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

## Usage

First, name your team on the landing page.

Once your team is generated, you can rename players by clicking on the little pencil located in the upper-right corner of their box. Entering a name of another existing player will reject the name change.
